# AtliQ-Grands-Hospitality-Insights-Project

## Python Data Analysis Project

### Overview
Welcome to the AtliQ Grands Hospitality Insights project! This project focuses on providing data-driven insights for AtliQ Grands, a company that owns multiple five-star hotels across India. The project aims to tackle the challenges faced by the company in the luxury/business hotel category, where market share and revenue are declining due to ineffective decision-making and competition. By leveraging Python, this project provides actionable insights using historical data to support strategic moves and regain market share.

### Project Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to perform an in-depth data analysis using Python to identify key trends, patterns, and insights that will enable AtliQ Grands to make informed business decisions. This project aims to:
- Analyze historical data to understand trends in revenue, occupancy rates, and customer preferences.
- Identify areas where AtliQ Grands can improve to regain market share in the luxury/business hotel category.
- Provide recommendations to the management based on data-driven insights.

### Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands has been experiencing a decline in market share and revenue due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective decision-making. The company lacks an in-house data analytics team, resulting in a lack of valuable insights from their historical data. The goal of this project is to fill this gap by providing meaningful data analysis that will help the management make better decisions.
